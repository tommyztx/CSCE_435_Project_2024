# CSCE 435 Group project

## 0. Group number: 10

## 1. Group members:
1. Thomas Zheng
2. Albert Yin
3. Paul Bae
4. Krish Chhabra

## 2. Project topic (e.g., parallel sorting algorithms)

### 2a. Brief project description (what algorithms will you be comparing and on what architectures)

- Bitonic Sort: 
- Sample Sort: 
- Merge Sort: 
- Radix Sort: Radix sort is a non-comparative sorting algorithm that orders elements by processing them digit by digit. Radix sort operates by sorting numbers based on individual digits, starting from the least significant digit (LSD) and moving towards the most significant digit (MSD). It is a non comparative sorting algorithm that ends up being slower than comparison algorithmns in most situations.

### 2b. Pseudocode for each parallel algorithm
- For MPI programs, include MPI calls you will use to coordinate between processes

### 2c. Evaluation plan - what and how will you measure and compare
- Input sizes, Input types
- Strong scaling (same problem size, increase number of processors/nodes)
- Weak scaling (increase problem size, increase number of processors)
